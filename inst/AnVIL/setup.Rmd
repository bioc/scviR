The scviR package should only be installed and used with 
```
PIP_USER=false
```
in the `.Renviron` file read by Rstudio or the Jupyter R kernel.  With
a fresh Rstudio-capable cloud environment:

```
BiocManager::install("vjcitn/scviR")
library(scviR)
scvi = scviR() # will use basilisk to set up miniconda
```

the necessary packages will be installed in .local rather than .cache if
`PIP_USER` is true.

If  `.Renviron` cannot be modified, the following workaround
can be used, but attend to the versions which may not be accurate
as packages evolve:

```
export nn=`find .cache/R/basilisk/1.10.2/scviR -name site-packages`
cp -r .local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/* $nn
```

now `scvi = scviR()` will succeed.
