# Crucial post-installation step

does not seem to obviate the need for the following.

- BiocManager::install("vjcitn/scviR")
- library(scviR)
- scvi = scviR() # will use basilisk to set up miniconda

but the necessary packages are installed in .local rather than .cache

To solve this:

```
export nn=`find .cache/R/basilisk/1.10.2/scviR -name site-packages`
cp -r .local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/* $nn
```

now `scvi = scviR()` will succeed.
