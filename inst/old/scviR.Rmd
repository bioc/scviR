# Overview

As of Jan 27 2023, the [scvi-tools](https://scvi-tools.org/) is
an element of the [scverse](https://scverse.org/) toolchest for
single-cell omics data analysis.

The scviR package is a very elementary approach to interfacing
between R, Bioconductor and scvi-tools.  

- scvi-tools components develop rapidly; we are
using [basilisk](https://bioconductor.org/packages/basilisk)
to manage R/python interoperation, and as of current
writing we work with version 0.18.0 of scvi-tools.  Specific
versions of python components are enumerated in the file R/basilisk.R.
- We have found it useful to use both R and python in our
overview vignette, which renders nicely with Rstudio 2022.12.0 Build 353.
- We have had difficulty achieving GPU connectivity
with a number of platforms.  A docker container based on a PyTorch-oriented image in
the [NVIDIA container registry](nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:22.12-py3)
R 4.2.2 and sufficient python 3 infrastructure to use scvi-tools 0.18.0
and scviR 0.0.1.  A Dockerfile is in scviR/inst/Docker.


# A CITE-seq example

The following code retrieves two _preprocessed_ anndata files
from a YosefLab GitHub repository and drops them in a newly created
folder `./data` relative to the vignette executing
folder.  There is a total of 42 MB of CITE-seq
data retrieved.  [N.B. This process would not be
allowed in a Bioconductor package, but an ExperimentHub
instance should be created and used.]

The details of production of the anndata instances that are downloaded
are available in
```
https://github.com/scverse/scvi-tools/blob/0.18.x/scvi/data/_built_in_data/_cite_seq.py
```
which refers to
```
https://github.com/YosefLab/totalVI_reproducibility/blob/master/data/data_filtering_scripts/pbmc_10k/pbmc_10k.py```
that gives all the code for doublet detection and outlier handling.

## Acquisition of example data

```{r lk1}
library(scviR)
scvi = scviR()
adata = scvi$data$pbmcs_10x_cite_seq() # to current ./data folder
```

## Preprocessing 

It is not clear how to do the following operation
with `layers["counts"]` in R so we bridge to
python, taking advantage of quarto.
```{python try1}
r.adata.layers["counts"] = r.adata.X.copy()
```
We keep going with python to carry out basic
preprocessing with scanpy.
```{python try2}
import scanpy as sc   # note scanpyR() can be used
sc.pp.normalize_total(r.adata, target_sum=1e4)
sc.pp.log1p(r.adata)
r.adata.raw = r.adata
r.adata
```

We'll continue with the tutorial workflow.  The
steps just shown do not take much time, and the download
is not repeated -- the scvi code checks for the contents
of the `./data` folder.

## Gene filtering

```{python filt}
sc.pp.highly_variable_genes(
    r.adata, 
    n_top_genes=4000, 
    flavor="seurat_v3",
    batch_key="batch", 
    subset=True,
    layer="counts"
)
```

## Setup and VAE fitting


```{python dofit}
r.scvi.model.TOTALVI.setup_anndata(
    r.adata, 
    protein_expression_obsm_key="protein_expression",
    layer="counts", 
    batch_key="batch"
)
vae = r.scvi.model.TOTALVI(r.adata, latent_distribution="normal")
r.adata.write("demo1.h5ad")
```

This step can take up to 40 minutes when no GPU is available.

```{python fitvae,eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
vae.train()
vae.save("vae1_ov")
vae
```

A saved version of the VAE can be restored.
```{python dorest, message=FALSE}
pvae = r.scvi.model._totalvi.TOTALVI.load("vae1_ov", r.adata, use_gpu=False)
pvae
```
The structure of the autoencoder:

```{python look}
pvae.module
```
