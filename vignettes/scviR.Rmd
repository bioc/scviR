# Overview

[scvi-tools](https://scvi-tools.org/) is
an element of the [scverse](https://scverse.org/) toolchest for
single-cell omics data analysis.

The scviR package is a very elementary approach to interfacing
between R, Bioconductor and scvi-tools.  

- scvi-tools components develop rapidly; we are
using [basilisk](https://bioconductor.org/packages/basilisk)
to manage R/python interoperation, and as of current
writing we work with version 0.20.0 of scvi-tools.  Specific
versions of python components are enumerated in the file R/basilisk.R.
- A docker container based on a PyTorch-oriented image in
the [NVIDIA container registry](nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:22.12-py3) includes
R 4.2.2 and sufficient python 3 infrastructure to use scvi-tools 0.20.0
and scviR 0.0.2.  A Dockerfile is in scviR/inst/Docker;
`vjcitn/nvidpt_bioc:0.0.2` can be pulled from dockerhub, it reports
size 26.5GB.  
- Code presented in the cite-seq tutorial
vignette follows [the colab notebook
for scvi-tools 0.18.0](https://colab.research.google.com/github/scverse/scvi-tutorials/blob/0.18.0/totalVI.ipynb).  *We will check for modifications in the scvi-tools 0.20.0 notebook*.
- Additional work on this package will facilitate comparisons between
outcomes of Bioconductor, scVI, and other analytic toolkits in the
single-cell domain.

# Installation

As of Feb 2023, use BiocManager to install scviR in R 4.2.2 or above:
```
BiocManager::install("vjcitn/scviR")
```
Be sure the `remotes` package has been installed.
