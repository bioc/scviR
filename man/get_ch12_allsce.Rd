\description{
get list of cluster-specific SCE for 10k PBMC annotated as in OSCA book chapter 12
}
\note{
This is a list of SingleCellExperiment instances with data on a total of 7472 cells from a 10x
CITE-seq experiment.  An altExp component in each list element includes
antibody-derived tag (ADT) counts on 17 proteins.  The data are acquired and
processed as described in ch 12 of the OSCA book, circa February 2023.
List elements correspond to mRNA-based sub-clusters of ADT-based clusters.
